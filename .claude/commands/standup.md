<!-- PARCH standup flow report: team derived from current and recent ticket assignments, no hard-coded names.
     Persistent defaults are read from .claude/standup-context.json: "defaultExclude" lists engineers always
     omitted from the report, and "pto" lists date-ranged absences ({ name, start, end, note } in YYYY-MM-DD).
     "events" lists upcoming events: { date: "YYYY-MM-DD", name: "...", note: "..." }.
     CLI: --exclude "Name1, Name2" or --ignore "Name1, Name2" adds to the default exclude list for this run.
          --project KEY overrides the default Jira project (default: PARCH).
          --skip-github skips GitHub PR activity fetching for In Review cards (faster, less data). -->

If $ARGUMENTS contains a natural-language exclusion request (e.g. "omit Jeffrey and Thomas", "exclude Richard", "ignore Thomas and Jeffrey") or uses --ignore, extract the names and rewrite the command using --exclude:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/standup.js --exclude "Name1, Name2"
```

Otherwise run:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/standup.js $ARGUMENTS
```

The script writes the HTML report to a dated temp file, opens it in the default browser, and prints the exact output path to stdout on a line starting with `HTML_OUT:`. It also outputs a markdown data summary to stdout.

Once you have the stdout output:

1. Display the **Computed SLE** and **Team Status** sections verbatim, without any modification or commentary.
2. Then provide a prioritized list of actionable recommendations grounded in kanban flow principles, using the Multi-Ticket Owners and Collaborator Load sections as supporting data. Do not reprint those sections.

Write recommendations as a team facilitator, not a manager. These appear in standup where the whole team is present -- they are prompts for conversation, not instructions. Keep this in mind throughout:
- Frame action items as questions: "Can X review Y today?" not "X needs to review Y"
- Acknowledge data gaps openly before drawing conclusions: if the standup data is incomplete, say so
- The team is collectively responsible for flow; avoid language that singles out one person as failing or at fault
- When uncertainty exists -- no linked PR found, GitHub not checked, Jira not recently updated -- say so explicitly, then ask the team to weigh in rather than asserting what's happening

Recommendations must cover:

- **WIP violations**: anyone over 1 active card (flag 2 as a concern, 3+ as critical); count collaborator cards toward effective WIP, not just assigned cards
- **Collaboration concentration**: flag any engineer carrying heavy collaborator load alongside their own assigned work; call out cards where the collaborator count is high enough to suggest the work should be reassigned or split
- **Escalation candidates**: any card marked ⚠ in the cycle time report has exceeded its story-point-adjusted SLE. For each, identify the blocker type (external dependency, waiting on response, unclear scope, under-resourced, etc.) and recommend a concrete escalation action -- whether to reassign, park as blocked, pair someone on it, or escalate to a dependency owner. These take priority over generic aging flags.
- **Aging items**: flag anything beyond 1 week in any status not already covered by escalation; treat 2+ weeks as critical and name the blocker type
- **Status bottlenecks**: for cards in In Review, Ready to Deploy, or any non-In Progress status, report what the data shows and surface questions for the team:
  - If GitHub PR activity is present for an In Review card: summarize the state (who's reviewing, last activity timestamp, review decision). If the review looks healthy and recent, say so briefly -- do not flag it as a bottleneck. Only raise a concern if the data shows genuine stagnation: multiple days with no activity, open change requests with no follow-up, or no reviewer assigned at all.
  - If no linked PR was found for an In Review card: say so explicitly ("the standup skill didn't find a linked PR for TICKET-nnn") and ask the team whether a review is in progress, and if not, who can take it.
  - If `--skip-github` was used or a PR fetch failed: note the data gap and ask the team to confirm whether review activity is under way before treating the card as blocked.
- **Available engineers**: for each engineer listed as available in Team Status, confirm or adjust the suggested next card
- **Specific next actions**: name the engineer, the ticket, and the concrete step that unblocks it

Format recommendations as markdown. Use headers, bold text, and bullet lists -- no pipe tables. Every ticket reference must be a markdown link to its Jira card (https://covermymeds.atlassian.net/browse/ISSUE-nnn). Name engineers and tickets specifically, but frame actions as questions and suggestions, not orders. Prioritize by flow impact, not by age alone.

After generating recommendations, identify the output path from the `HTML_OUT:` line in stdout, then use the Edit tool on that file to replace `<!-- RECOMMENDATIONS_PLACEHOLDER -->` with the recommendations formatted as HTML. Use `<h3>` for section headers, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<ul>`/`<li>` for lists, `<strong>` for bold, and `<a href="...">` for ticket links. Do not include the outer `<h2>Recommendations</h2>` heading -- that is already in the file.
