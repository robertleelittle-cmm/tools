## What an EM review is

An EM review is a SOX/ITGC compliance gate — the final human sign-off before a change goes to production. It is **not** a second code review. You are checking that the correct process was followed. Your output is a short, copyable report suitable for posting as a GitHub PR comment alongside the approval.

## Step 1: Identify the PR

Extract the PR number and repo from $ARGUMENTS. Default repo: `covermymeds/drugs-api`.

Accepted forms: a bare number (`114`), a `#number`, a full GitHub URL, or `owner/repo#number`.

## Step 2: Gather data in parallel

Fetch all of these at once:

```bash
# PR metadata, description, reviewer list, state
gh pr view <NUMBER> --repo <OWNER>/<REPO>

# General comment thread
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/issues/<NUMBER>/comments

# Review decisions with timestamps
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<NUMBER>/reviews

# Commit history with timestamps
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<NUMBER>/commits

# CODEOWNERS (try .github/ first, then repo root)
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/contents/.github/CODEOWNERS --jq '.content' | base64 -d \
  || gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/contents/CODEOWNERS --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Extract any Jira ticket key(s) from the PR description. Match any `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` pattern or Jira URL. Fetch each with the Atlassian Rovo MCP:
- Tool: `getJiraIssue`, `cloudId`: `covermymeds.atlassian.net`
- `fields`: `["summary", "description", "status", "assignee", "comment"]`
- `responseContentFormat`: `"markdown"`

**Determine review flow** — two distinct paths, same 7 criteria, satisfied differently:

- **Standard flow**: No STCM ticket is present. The repo is itself a SOX-compliant system of record (application repos going through GitHub + DeployWizard). The PR plus a linked Jira work ticket (e.g. `PARCH-123`) together constitute the audit trail. This is the common case.

- **STCM flow**: An `STCM-xxxx` ticket is present. The repo is NOT a self-managing SOX system of record (Puppet, Terraform, infrastructure, credential rotations, manual DB operations). The STCM ticket is the change record — it captures authorization, peer review, EM approval, risk, testing evidence, and change window. The PR alone is not sufficient evidence; the STCM is the evidence.

## Step 3: Build the report

The report has three parts. Keep each part tight — this should fit in a GitHub PR comment.

---

### Part A: Change summary (ELI5)

Write 2–3 sentences describing what this PR does and why, pitched at a technically literate reader who doesn't know this specific codebase. Name the files or components changed but explain what they do rather than assuming familiarity. Then add one sentence on the change record:

- **Standard flow**: state whether the Jira done-when criteria are satisfied ("The done-when criteria are met: …" or "The done-when criteria are **not** fully met because …").
- **STCM flow**: state whether the STCM description matches the change and whether it is approved or still pending ("The STCM accurately describes this change and is approved." or "The STCM [does not match / is still pending approval] because …").

---

### Part B: Compliance checklist

Assess each criterion. Use: ✅ PASS, ❌ FAIL, ⚠️ NEEDS INFO.

Use FAIL when the criterion is clearly not met. Use NEEDS INFO only when you genuinely cannot determine the answer from available data. An absent item (no ticket linked, no risk statement anywhere) is a FAIL, not NEEDS INFO.

---

**1. Authorized change record** — A valid change record is linked and covers the change.

Standard flow:
- Work story ticket key present in PR description?
- The ticket's done-when criteria are met. Related cleanup or incidental fixes are acceptable as long as AC is met and the extra changes are clearly related — only flag if additions are substantial and plainly outside the ticket's intent.
- Ticket status is active (not Backlog or Closed - Won't Do)?

STCM flow:
- STCM ticket key present in PR description?
- STCM description accurately reflects the change being made (not a generic placeholder)?
- STCM is in an active workflow state (not Draft, not Closed - Won't Do)?
- If STCM is pending only manager/EM approval ("Manager Review Still Needed" or equivalent): this is acceptable — the EM conducting this review approves the STCM first, then approves the PR. Note it in the output.
- If STCM is still pending peer review from a non-EM: that is a blocker (see criterion 2).

---

**2. Code review complete** — A non-author peer review occurred; no unresolved questions in the thread.
- At least one approval from someone other than the PR author?
- Open questions in the comment thread answered?

*(Same for both flows.)*

---

**3. Segregation of duties** — Author ≠ approver.
- PR author is not the same person as any reviewer who submitted an approval?

*(Same for both flows.)*

---

**4. Risk assessed** — An explicit risk level is stated. Anything above low-risk names risks and mitigations.
- Is there a risk statement ("Low / Medium / High / RMT:")?
- Standard flow: look in the PR description or the linked work ticket.
- STCM flow: look in the STCM description (risk is a required field of the STCM record).
- If medium/high: specific risks named with mitigations?
- No risk statement found anywhere = FAIL.

---

**5. Testing evidence valid** — Evidence demonstrates the specific change worked.
- Evidence present (log output, screenshots, CI results)?
  - Standard flow: evidence is in the PR description.
  - STCM flow: evidence may be in the STCM ticket instead of the PR — check both.
- Evidence shows the specific behavior described in the change (not just "app starts")?
- For low-risk changes, CI green is sufficient. For medium/high, prefer screenshots or live-environment log output — note if CI-only evidence is present for a non-low-risk change.
- Do NOT compare screenshot or manual-test timestamps to commit timestamps. Test environments are deployed and tested independently, and evidence is typically captured before the final commit push. Timestamps on screenshots are irrelevant — only content matters.

---

**6. Change history intact** — All code changes fall within the authorized window.

Standard flow:
- The last code-changing commit's timestamp must be ≤ the peer review approval timestamp.
- Post-approval commits that are purely documentation or configuration commentary do not require re-approval — note them as informational only.
- A post-approval commit that touches code or schema = FAIL.

STCM flow:
- The STCM must be fully approved before the PR is merged or the change is applied to production. An STCM in draft or pending non-EM approval at merge time = FAIL.
- Exception: if the STCM is pending only manager/EM approval, the EM approves the STCM first as part of this review — that satisfies the pre-merge requirement. Note this sequence in the output rather than failing.
- If a change window is visible in the STCM, all commits must fall within it. Commits outside the window = FAIL.
- The peer review (criterion 2) check still applies independently.

---

**7. Production intent confirmed** — PR is not a draft; no WIP/DO-NOT-MERGE markers.
- PR not in draft state?
- Title/description free of "WIP", "DO NOT MERGE", "draft"?

*(Same for both flows.)*

---

### Part C: CODEOWNERS gate

After assessing the 7 criteria, check whether all required CODEOWNERS approvals are in:

- Parse the CODEOWNERS file: each line is `<path-pattern> <owner> [<owner> ...]`. A pattern matches if the PR touches any file under that path. `*` matches everything.
- For each pattern that matches the PR's changed files, check whether at least one of the listed owners has submitted an APPROVED review.
- If any required owner group has not approved, list them explicitly — this does not change the 7-criteria verdict, but the PR is not actually mergeable and the EM comment should say so.

### Part D: Verdict

One of three:
- **APPROVED** — all 7 criteria pass
- **NOT APPROVED** — one or more FAIL
- **PENDING** — one or more NEEDS INFO, no FAILs

---

## Step 4: Output format

Produce this as a single markdown block, ready to paste as a GitHub PR comment:

```
## EM Review

**Change:** <one sentence ELI5 of what this does>
**Record:** <one sentence on change record status — done-when for standard flow, STCM authorization for STCM flow>

| # | Criterion | Result | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Authorized change record | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |
| 2 | Code review complete | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |
| 3 | Segregation of duties | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |
| 4 | Risk assessed | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |
| 5 | Testing evidence valid | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |
| 6 | Change history intact | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |
| 7 | Production intent confirmed | ✅/❌/⚠️ | |

**Verdict: APPROVED / NOT APPROVED / PENDING**
```

Fill in the Notes column only for non-passing items — one clause is enough ("no ticket linked", "author approved own PR", "evidence predates last commit by 3 days"). Leave Notes blank for passing items to keep the table readable.

If NOT APPROVED or PENDING, add a brief "**To reach approval:**" bullet list naming exactly what must change.

If APPROVED with no pending CODEOWNERS, add one line: "Ready for EM sign-off — GitHub approval + checklist completion required before merge."

If APPROVED and the STCM is pending manager/EM approval, replace that line with: "Approve [STCM-XXXXX](link) first, then submit GitHub approval here."

If APPROVED but CODEOWNERS-required approvals are still pending, add instead:
"⚠️ SOX criteria met, but the following required CODEOWNERS approvals are still outstanding — PR is not mergeable until these are in: `<owner/team>` (for `<path pattern>`)"
